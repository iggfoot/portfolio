            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <p>My name is Ian Neville, and I design fun web applications!</p>
            <p>I'm a recent graduate of the Front End Web Development Bootcamp<br>
                at Thinkful. As a child, I loved solving puzzles because they<br>
                allowed me to stretch my mind and imagination. Coding has gifted<br>
                me new methods to solve bigger and more realistic problems.<br>
                <br>
                Outside of Coding, I'm a movie enthusiast and avid reader. <br>
                Another interest of mine is collecting sneaker - which came <br>
                out of having a larger than average shoe size. A friend of <br>
                mine dubbed me "Iggfoot" - a combination of Ian and Bigfoot. <br>
                One day I hope to learn how to make sneakers from scratch just <br>
                like I learned web development from scratch.
